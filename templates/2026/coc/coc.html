              The Python Software Community across Africa is vibrant, consisting of members with diverse skills, personalities, cultures, and experiences. It's through these differences that our community finds strength and achieves growth. We encourage all community interactions to be guided by the following principles, which help steer our interactions and maintain a positive, successful, and growing community:

              <li><strong>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism:</strong> Disagreements, when approached with openness and respect, can lead to growth and understanding.</li>
              <li><strong>Using welcoming and inclusive language:</strong> Our community thrives on involvement from all people, making a concerted effort to be inclusive to all.</li>
