    <p class=" text-center">
        PyLadies Kampala has partnered with the NgomBor Community Development Alliance and is hosting a zero to hero program 
        at PyCon Uganda 2025 for women affected by the LRA war. Our hope is that the women will take back home some tech skills that 
        will be the starting point for income generating capacity. The women will join our other mentorship programs like Outreachy
        and Google summer of code preparatory programs to apply for paid opportuntities
        The NgomBor Community supports rural youths with computer education and also works with individuals and families who fled from Congo, 
        helping them rebuild through learning. Pyladies is excited to open our workshop doors this year.
