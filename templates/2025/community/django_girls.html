<section class="container py-5 section">
    <h2>Django Girls Workshop FAQ</h2>
    <p><strong>Do I need programming experience to join?</strong></p>
    <p>No! This workshop is for beginners. You don't need any prior knowledge. If you have some technical knowledge (like knowing what HTML or CSS are), you can still apply!</p>
    <p><strong>Should I bring my Own Laptop</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, please bring your own laptop. We don't provide hardware, and it's important for you to have your computer to take home everything you create during the workshop.</p>
    <p><strong>Do I need to Install anything on my Laptop before hand?</strong></p>
    <p>It would be helpful to have Python installed, but don't worry if you haven't done it yet. We'll have an installation session before the workshop to help you get set up.</p>
    <p><strong>Do I need to be a PyLady already to attend?</strong></p>
    <p>No. Simply sign up for the workshop session, and you're welcome to join other activities if you're interested.</p>
