              <p>Our attendees' health and safety remain our top priority and we look to the venue, and Ministry of Health guidelines to make the best and most informed decisions around onsite safety and requirements so we will be erring on the side of safety for all participants.</p>
              
              <h3 class="section-title">Attendance</h3>
              <p>Individuals should not attend the event if they are COVID-positive, are exhibiting COVID symptoms (<a href="https://www.health.go.ug/covid/"> as defined by the Ministry of Health </a>), or have been exposed, within 7 days prior to the event, to someone who was COVID-positive or showed COVID symptoms.</p>
              
              <p>If you are feeling sick or exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, or test positive for COVID-19, prior to the start of the conference, or on any day of the conference, please contact us at pyconug@pycon.org, and we will exchange your ticket type for an online ticket or grant you a refund.</p>
              
              <h3 class="section-title">Travel</h3>
              <p>Anyone traveling to the event should read and abide by the <a href="https://ug.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information-page/"> Travel Guidelines </a> for domestic and international travel. We ask that participants respect fellow attendees and do everything possible to ensure an environment that is as safe as possible.</p>
              
              <h3 class="section-title">Ebola Update</h3>
              <p>Uganda was officially declared Ebola-free as of 11th January 2023. <a href="https://www.afro.who.int/countries/uganda/news/uganda-declares-end-ebola-disease-outbreak">More details...</a></p>
              
              <h3 class="section-title">Monitoring of the Requirements Will Continue</h3>
              <p>We have monitored COVID-related news and data since the pandemic started, and we will continue to do so moving forward. We continue to follow all Ministry of Health guidelines in addition to those of the local government and venue. International, national, regional, and local sources are closely watched and will result in a change of policy if warranted.</p>
              
              <h3 class="section-title">Commitment to Compliance</h3>
              <p>PyCon Uganda takes these Health & Safety Guidelines very seriously and will therefore enforce a 3-strike rule. Anyone who violates these guidelines on three separate accounts, such as continuing not to wear a proper mask or disregarding social distancing, is subject to removal from the conference.</p>
