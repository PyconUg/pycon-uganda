                <p>
                  PyCon Uganda is looking for speakers of all experience levels
                  and backgrounds to contribute to the conference program! If
                  you are a professional Python user, hobbyist, or just
                  passionate about Python or programming and open-source
                  communities, we would kindly love to hear from you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We are excited and humbled to receive your talk and kindly, we
                  request you to read the following information before
                  submitting your proposal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Everyone is encouraged to submit a proposal regardless of
                  their experience level. PyCon Uganda thrives on having talks
                  ranging from introductory to advanced.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Before writing up a proposal</strong>, read the
                  following descriptions of the four kinds of presentations at
                  PyCon Uganda.
                </p>

                <h3 class="mt-4">Talks</h3>
                <p>
                  These are the traditional talk sessions given during the main
                  conference days. Most talks are 30 minutes long, but we do
                  offer a limited number of 45-minute slots for important
                  topics.
                </p>

                <h3 class="mt-4">Tutorials</h3>
                <p>
                  Each tutorial session runs for 3 hours and takes place on the
                  22nd and 23rd of September, 2023, before the main conference
                  days. We're looking for sessions that advance the Python
                  community.
                </p>

                <h3 class="mt-4">Full-time Trainers</h3>
                <p>
                  We invite educators to share their coursework and engage the
                  community through practical training sessions.
                </p>

                <h3 class="mt-4">Lightning Talks</h3>
                <p>
                  Lightning talks are short, 10â€“15 minute presentations. If your
                  main proposal isn't selected, this is another chance to share
                  your ideas!
                </p>

                <p>
                  All speakers are expected to read and adhere to the conference
                  <a href="/2025/coc/" class="text-primary">Code of Conduct</a>.
                  Slide content and spoken material must be appropriate for a
                  professional and inclusive audience.
                </p>
