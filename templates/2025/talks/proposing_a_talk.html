                  <p>
                    PyCon Uganda is looking for speakers of all experience levels and backgrounds to contribute to the conference program! If you are a professional Python user, hobbyist, or just passionate about Python or programming and open-source communities, we would kindly love to hear from you.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We are excited and humbled to receive your talk and kindly, we request you to read the following information before submitting your proposal.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Everyone is encouraged to submit a proposal regardless of their experience level. PyCon Uganda thrives on having talks ranging from introductory to advanced.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Before writing a proposal</strong>, read the following descriptions of the four kinds of presentations at PyCon Uganda:
                  </p>

                  <h3 class="mt-4">Talks</h3>
                  <p>These are the traditional talk sessions given during the main conference days and they are 28 minutes long.</p>

                  <h3 class="mt-4">Tutorials</h3>
                  <p>
                    Each tutorial session runs for 3 hours and takes place on the 6th and 7th of August, 2024, before the main conference days. We're looking for sessions that advance the Python community.
                  </p>

                  <h3 class="mt-4">Full-time Trainers
                  </h3>
                  <p>We invite educators to share their coursework and engage the community through practical training sessions.

                  </p>

                  <h3 class="mt-4">Lightning Talks
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    Lightning talks are short, 10â€“15 minute presentations. If your main proposal isn't selected, this is another chance to share your ideas!

                  </p>

                  <p>
                    All speakers must follow the
