                        PyCon Uganda 2025 is offering grants to attendees and speakers, so
                        that those who might otherwise not be able to attend wonâ€™t hesitate to
                        participate. Some expenses for the conference attendance (which can
                        include travel, hotel, registration etc.) will be covered for
                        opportunity grant recipients. We actively encourage people to apply
                        for an opportunity grant. While we wish we could give grants to
                        everyone who applies, we do not have the funds to do that. Our goal is
                        to maximise the impact our grant program has, within the limited funds
                        we have.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We try to do this in a number of ways:
                        <br />
                        <ul className="list-disc list-inside md:list-inside">
                          <li>
                            Conferences are a meeting place for developers from all around the
                            globe. Therefore, the selection process is designed to benefit
                            people that we believe make a difference, particularly speakers
                            and tutorial presenters.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Additionally, the selection process attempts to promote a more
                            diverse PyCon Uganda. While encouraging diversity takes many
                            forms, weâ€™re happy to use the opportunity grant program as a very
                            direct method of supporting diversity within the Django community.
                            In particular, our grant program prioritises people part of an
                            underrepresented or marginalised group in tech, as these people
                            are more likely to experience hardships and difficulties in
                            traveling to our events and being a part of our community.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            When prioritising grant applications, we try to get a feel for how
                            much impact this grant will have on the applicant and the wider
                            community and country, compared to others. In this, we consider
                            things like involvement in a local community, social impact of the
                            applicantâ€™s activities, and how accessible other conferences are
                            to them.

                        If you are an accepted speaker, and you donâ€™t need a grant because
                        your employer is funding your conference costs, we can recognise your
                        employer for this. For now weâ€™re planning to get their logo in the
                        programme, next to your talk. This is opt-in. With this, we hope to
                        make it a bit easier for you to convince your employer to contribute
                        towards your conference costs as a speaker.
